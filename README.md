Hi there! 👋
I'm Jyothsna Rani Gajula, a passionate Identity & Access Management (IAM) professional with over 8 years of experience architecting, designing, and managing enterprise-wide IAM and CIAM solutions across multi-cloud and hybrid environments.

💼 Professional Background
🎓 Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication from JNTUA, India.
🌐 Currently working as Senior Okta IAM Engineer at Fiserv.
🚀 Previously worked with Cognizant, Honeywell, and Capgemini in various IAM/CIAM engineering roles.
🔐 Specialized in Okta, Azure AD, SailPoint, CyberArk, Ping Identity, and AWS IAM.

🔭 What I Worked On

Designed enterprise IAM solutions integrating Okta, Azure AD, and Active Directory for secure access across hybrid and multi-cloud setups.

Implemented CIAM platforms (Okta CIAM, Auth0, PingOne) with features like progressive profiling, self-service registration, and passwordless authentication.

Built IGA workflows (SailPoint IdentityIQ, Saviynt) to streamline RBAC, certification campaigns, and SoD enforcement.

Automated identity lifecycle using Okta Workflows, SCIM APIs, Terraform, and Ansible, improving compliance and operational efficiency.

Integrated PAM solutions (CyberArk, BeyondTrust) with SIEM tools like Splunk and Microsoft Sentinel for compliance and real-time monitoring.

🌱 What I'm Learning

My passion lies in enabling Zero Trust security architectures and compliance-driven IAM strategies. I am constantly learning about:

Evolving authentication standards like FIDO2/WebAuthn.

Advanced cloud-native IAM models (AWS IAM Identity Center, Azure Entra ID).

Leveraging automation with Python, PowerShell, and Terraform for scalable IAM deployments.
